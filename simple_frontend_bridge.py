‚Ä¢ **Sample Submission**: Upload documents and I'll extract sample information using AI
‚Ä¢ **Sample Management**: Create, edit, and track samples with barcodes
‚Ä¢ **Storage System**: Manage sample locations and storage conditions
‚Ä¢ **Sequencing Jobs**: Set up and track sequencing workflows
‚Ä¢ **Templates**: Use Excel templates for batch sample uploads
‚Ä¢ **Reports**: Generate custom reports and analytics

To submit samples, you can:
1. Use the RAG document processing feature to upload lab submission forms
2. Manually create samples using the sample creation form
3. Upload Excel templates with sample data

‚Ä¢ **Barcode Scanning**: Use barcodes to track sample movements
‚Ä¢ **Capacity Management**: Monitor storage capacity and utilization
‚Ä¢ **Sample Movement**: Log when samples are moved between locations

Storage best practices:
- DNA samples: -20¬∞C or -80¬∞C for long-term storage
- RNA samples: -80¬∞C (very temperature sensitive)
- Protein samples: -80¬∞C with appropriate buffers
- Cell cultures: Liquid nitrogen or -80¬∞C
